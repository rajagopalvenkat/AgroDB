The utility is a python program that uses multiple modules to represent data in tabular as well as graphical format.
Graphs for specific queries can be generated using a simple GUI interface.

Basically, this can be modified into a tool to generate graphical representations of data, using custom search queries.

Install the following python(2.7) packages first - 

PIL
Tkinter
MySQLdb
tkintertable
numpy
matplotlib

## Script to auto-install above modules to be added soon ##

Set up mysql-server on your machine.

Ubuntu users can use 'sudo apt-get install mysql-server'.

The utility was developed in terms of an agricultural database management software. The program assumes the existence of the following tables in a mysql database named 'AGRICULTURE' :

Andhra_Pradesh
Assam
Bihar
Gujarat
Haryana
Himachal_Pradesh
Jammu_and_Kashmir
Karnataka
Kerala
Madhya_Pradesh
Maharashtra
Manipur
Meghalaya
Nagaland
Orissa
Punjab
Rajasthan
Sikkim
Tamil_Nadu
Tripura
Uttar_Pradesh
Uttaranchal
West_Bengal
Mordor

each with the following fields: 

DISTRICT - VARCHAR(30)
YEAR - INTEGER
CROP - VARCHAR(30)
AREA - FLOAT
PRODUCTION - FLOAT
YIELD - FLOAT

## A script to auto-generate these tables to be added soon. ##

Execute 'python AgroDB.py' on the command line.
Login using the credentials you provided when setting up mysql-server.


Customization Scope

Renaming the database, tables and the corresponding values/variables in the python source code (and choosing relevant images for the aesthetically oriented) can essentially lead to this being used as an analysis tool for any sort of data.
